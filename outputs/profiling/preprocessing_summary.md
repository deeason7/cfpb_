##  Sprint 2: Deep Preprocessing Summary

**Records Retained:** 66,806

###  Major Preprocessing Steps:
- Dropped columns irrelevant for sentiment modeling: tags, company_public_response, consumer_consent_provided, consumer_complaint_narrative, complaint_id, date_received, date_sent_to_company, submitted_via, zipcode, sub_issue, sub_product, consumer_disputed?, company_response_to_consumer
- Text cleaning applied: Lowercased, special characters/HTML/URLs/emails/numbers removed, normalized spacing.
- Smart Weak Sentiment Labeling using:
  - TextBlob polarity & subjectivity
  - Keyword-based checks (extreme negative, negative, neutral indicators)
  - POS tagging for emphasis and negation adjustments
- Added Encoded/Binary Columns:
  - `consumer_disputed_binary`
  - `timely_response_binary`
  - `sentiment_encoded` (0: Neutral, 1: Negative, 2: Extreme Negative)
- Added Features:
  - `text_length` (word count of cleaned text)
  - `product_dispute_rate` (target encoding with smoothing)
  - `company_dispute_rate` (target encoding with smoothing)
  - `sentiment_timely_interaction` (sentiment * timely response)
  - `company_timely_interaction` (company dispute rate * timely response)
- Missing states filled with 'Unknown'.
- Carefully preserved complaint narratives with sufficient information.
